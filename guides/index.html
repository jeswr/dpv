    <h2>DPV and Related Resources</h2>
    <p>[[[DPV]]]: is the base/core specification for the 'Data Privacy Vocabulary', which is extended for Personal Data [[PD]], Locations [[LOC]], Risk Management [[RISK]], Technology [[TECH]], and [[AI]]. Specific [[LEGAL]] extensions are also provided which model jurisdiction specific regulations and concepts . To support understanding and applications of [[DPV]], various guides and resources [[GUIDES]] are provided, including a [[PRIMER]].</p>
    <p>[[DPV]] and related resources are published on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/releases">GitHub</a>. For a general overview of the Data Protection Vocabularies and Controls Community Group [[DPVCG]], its history, deliverables, and activities - refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/"><u>DPVCG Website</u></a>. For meetings, see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/dpvcg/calendar">DPVCG calendar</a>.</p>
    <p>The peer-reviewed article “<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-33246-4_44"><u>Creating A Vocabulary for Data Privacy</u></a>” presents a historical overview of the DPVCG, and describes the methodology and structure of the DPV along with describing its creation.

    <section id="primer">
        <h2>Primer introducing DPV</h2>
        <p>The Data Privacy Vocabulary [[DPV]] enables expressing machine-readable metadata about the use and processing of personal data based on legislative requirements such as the General Data Protection Regulation [[GDPR]]. The [[[PRIMER]]] [[PRIMER]] introduces the fundamental structuring and use of concepts in DPV. It is intended to be a starting point for those wishing to use the DPV and an orientation for people from all disciplines. [[PRIMER-concise]] is a shorter version (2 pages) of the primer intended for a quick introduction.</p>

                <div class="issue" title="Guide for RDFS/SKOS - work in progress"></div>
            </p>
            <p>The [[[GUIDE-SKOS]]] [[GUIDE-SKOS]] provides guidance for the use of DPV as an RDFS ontology and a SKOS Taxonomy - which is its default serialisation. This guide is intended for applications where DPV is being used as a 'knowledge graph' along with some lightweight reasoning and validation processes. This guide is not suitable for applications which require the full expressivity or power of OWL2 based modelling and semantic reasoning - for which the <a href="#guide-owl">OWL2 guide</a> should be referred to.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="guide-owl">
            <h3>Using DPV with OWL2</h3>
            <p>The [[[GUIDE-OWL2]]] [[GUIDE-OWL2]] provides guidance for the use of DPV as an OWL2 ontology, and explains how DPV can be easily encoded in a low-complexity profile of OWL2 called OWL2-PL to perform efficient semantic reasoning.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The [[[GUIDE-MISCFORMAT]]] [[GUIDE-MISCFORMAT]] is a guide that will provide guidance for the use of DPV for use-cases that do not involve semantic web standards (e.g. RDF or OWL). It will explain how DPV can be utilised in a commonly utilised machine-readable form such as CSV or JSON.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The [[[GUIDE-ODRL]]] [[GUIDE-ODRL]] is a guide that will provide guidance for the use of DPV concepts with [[[ODRL-MODEL]]] and [[[ODRL-VOCAB]]]. ODRL is a W3C standard for machine-readable representations of policies and agreements. The aim of the guide will be to demonstrate the compatibility and alignment of DPV concepts with those from ODRL, and to guide adopters in using DPV concepts within ODRL and vice-versa. This will enable using DPV to represent policies and agreements as defined by the ODRL standard.</p>

            <p>[[[ISO-27560]]] provides guidance for the creation and maintainence of records regarding consent as machine-readable information. It also provides guidance on the use of this information to exchange such records between entities in the form of 'receipts'. The [[[GUIDE-Consent-27560]]] [[GUIDE-Consent-27560]] provides implementation of machine-readable consent records and receipts as defined in [[ISO-27560]] by using the <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv">Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)</a>.

            </p>
            <p>The [[[ISO-29184]]] provides a standard for privacy notices in terms of the information to be provided as well as its use to inform the data subject about processing of personal data. The DPVCG is currently working on a guide - [[[GUIDE-Notice-29184]]] [[GUIDE-Notice-29184]] to implement machine-readable notices using the [[DPV]]. The scope of this guide would be to create machine-readable notices that can provide the information as required for implementing [[ISO-29184]]. Additionally, the guide will also describe using [[ISO-29184]] for meeting [[GDPR]] requirements regarding privacy notices. It is intended to be a companion to the guide on consent records and receipts [[GUIDE-Consent-27560]]. The scope as of now does not include providing tools or libraries for the creation of graphical interfaces or other means to visually represent this information.</p>

            <p>The [[GDPR]] Article 30 requires keeping records of processing activities (ROPA) involving personal data, where the information to be maintained in such records includes purpose, personal data categories, technical and organisational measures utilised, and others. The DPVCG is currently working on a guide - [[[GUIDE-GDPR-ROPA]]] [[GUIDE-GDPR-ROPA]] to implement machine-readable ROPAs using the [[DPV]]. The scope of this guide would be to create machine-readable notices that can provide the information as required for implementing ROPA according to [[GDPR]] requirements. The scope as of now does not include providing tools or libraries for the creation of ROPA or interfaces or other means to work with this information.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The [[GDPR]] Article 35 requires a "Data Protection Impact Assessment" (DPIA) assessing the impact of processing activities involving personal data on the data subject's rights and freedoms. This requires maintaining information about whether such a DPIA is required, and if yes, then how it was conducted and what were its findings, and based on which whether processing activities were justified or were halted or not conducted. The DPVCG is currently working on a guide - [[[GUIDE-GDPR-DPIA]]] [[GUIDE-GDPR-DPIA]] to implement machine-readable DPIA using the [[DPV]]. The scope of this guide would be to create machine-readable DPIAs that can provide the information as required for implementing DPIA according to [[GDPR]] requirements. The scope as of now does not include providing tools or libraries for the creation of DPIA or interfaces or other means to work with this information.</p>

            <p>The [[GDPR]] Article 33 and 34 requires keeping records associated with suspicion or occurence of a data breach and its impacts, including any communications to the data subjects or authorities regarding it. The DPVCG is currently working on a guide - [[[GUIDE-GDPR-DataBreach]]] [[GUIDE-GDPR-DataBreach]] to implement machine-readable Data Breach records and notifications using the [[DPV]]. The scope of this guide would be to create machine-readable records and notices that can provide the information as required for implementing data breach assessments and notifications according to [[GDPR]] requirements.

            </p>
            <p>Regulations such as the [[GDPR]], amongst others across the globe, provide specific rights (to data subjects) through which they can avail of information regarding the processing of their personal data, object to it, or obtain a copy of their given personal data. The DPVCG is currently working on a guide - [[[GUIDE-Rights]]] [[GUIDE-Rights]] to implement machine-readable rights excercise records using the [[DPV]]. The scope of this guide would be to create machine-readable records that can provide the information as required for demonstrating rights exercise, its fulfilment or non-fulfilment, and the communications involved according to [[GDPR]] requirements. The scope as of now does not include providing tools or libraries for exercise or management of rights, or interfaces or other means to work with this information.</p>
